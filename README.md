# Email-Automation-Using-UiPath
UiPath Studio is a complete solution for application integration, and automating third-party applications, administrative IT tasks and business IT processes. One of the most important notions in Studio is the automation project.

A project is a graphical representation of a business process. It enables you to automate rule-based processes, by giving you full control of the execution order and the relationship between a custom set of steps, also known as activities in UiPath Studio. Each activity consists of a small action, such as clicking a button, reading a file or writing to a log panel.

The main types of supported projects are:

1. Sequences - suitable to linear processes, enabling you to smoothly go from one activity to another, without cluttering your project.
2. Flowcharts - suitable to a more complex business logic, enabling you to integrate decisions and connect activities in a more diverse manner, through multiple branching logic operators.
3. State Machines â€“ suitable for very large projects; they use a finite number of states in their execution which are triggered by a condition (transition) or activity.

Here we try to read an excel sheet with columns such as First Name , Last Name , Email Id and Location(City ). Email Id is blank which we create using the first and last name following a rule. This is a first step to sending automated mails.
